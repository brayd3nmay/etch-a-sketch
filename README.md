# 🕹️ Etch A Sketch

A browser-based Etch A Sketch game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Hover over the grid to draw—each square darkens by 10% on each pass until it's fully black. You can also resize the grid to create more detailed sketches.

Built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations curriculum.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Grid Drawing**  
  Hovering over each square increases its opacity, simulating sketching.
  
- **Custom Grid Resizing**  
  Click the "Resize Grid" button to change the grid size (up to 100×100).
  
- **Smooth Progressive Darkening**  
  Each cell darkens in 10% increments per mouseover.

- **Responsive Layout**  
  The grid resizes dynamically using Flexbox.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

- **DOM Manipulation**: Creating, resetting, and dynamically styling elements.
- **Event Handling**: Using event delegation to target mouseover behavior.
- **JavaScript Logic**: Opacity tracking, input handling, and conditional updates.
- **CSS Flexbox**: Built a grid layout that wraps cleanly for all sizes.
- **Clean UI Design**: Fonts, spacing, and buttons styled with polish.
